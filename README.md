Project Description:
Marine Institute (MI) to assign a graduate student to review and analyse data collected from the Cod Quality program for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 with the help of Dr. Arnault Le Bris. The review will include data exploration to identify and describe outliers, relationships among explanatory variables, the occurrence of zeros, among other data exploration tasks.
 
The cod quality database has information on:
Seasonality of catch rates and information on the timing and departure of cod from regions and/or bays.
Fishing and environmental factors that may affect catch quality, including water temperature, fishing depth, soak times, gear type and catch volume.
Handling and transport factors that may affect catch quality, including handling and transport time, onboard air temperature, and fish temperature during transport.
 
Response variables include the catch quality grade (e.g., A, B, C) but also counts of the different grading deductions for each fishing event, which is identified by a unique Batch ID. 
As it is expected that there may be differences among individual fish harvesters, grading technicians and plants, these data are represented by unique IDâ€™s, thereby protecting confidentiality.
 
The analysis shall include a description of the spatial extent, seasonality and vessel and gear types included in the database. Where there are sufficient data, data analyses will be constructed to answer the following:
Within the cod quality sampling period, when do cod arrive and leave fishing areas? How do catch rates change within regions and seasons?
What variables increase the probability of high-quality fish across various vessel sizes, gear types, and at what time of year?
Within the different vessel sizes, gear types and month, what variables increase the probability of high-quality fish?
What variable or sets of variables result in the primary grading deductions?
For the top 5 grading deduction categories, what are the key explanatory factors?
Determine if there is a seasonality aspect to the onset of deduction categories.
